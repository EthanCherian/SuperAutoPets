# Super Auto Pets!

This is my text-based recreation of the hit autobattler Super Auto Pets. The original, created by Team Wood Games, can be found [here](https://teamwoodgames.com/). It's free on Steam, Android, iOS, and on the web! I highly recommend you give it a try to understand what I tried to build here.

The source of much of my knowledge used to make this is the folks over at the [Super Auto Pets Wiki](https://superautopets.wiki.gg/wiki/Super_Auto_Pets_Wiki), who've put together a thorough and helpful resource!

## Execution

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE**: As of now, many things are displayed using emojis (as this was part of the original charm of SAP). To the best of my knowledge, only VS Code's terminal has the ability to display these emojis (don't ask me why lol). The app may prove unusable by any other means. I'm hard at work on a solution, should be out soon <sup>TM</sup>.

To run the program, simply execute the following command in the root directory:

```bash
python3 super_auto_pets.py
```

Your "team name" may be anything you wish, and I would recommend agreeing to backup your teams. They'll be added to the `data` folder, so you may battle against them later. Otherwise, you'll simply be facing the handful of teams that I happened to create, which should also work perfectly fine.
