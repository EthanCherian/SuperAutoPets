# Super Auto Pets!

This is my text-based recreation of the hit autobattler Super Auto Pets. The original, created by Team Wood Games, can be found [here](https://teamwoodgames.com/). It's free on Steam, Android, iOS, and on the web! I highly recommend you give it a try to understand what I tried to build here.

The source of much of my knowledge used to make this is the folks over at the [Super Auto Pets Wiki](https://superautopets.wiki.gg/wiki/Super_Auto_Pets_Wiki), who've put together a thorough and helpful resource!

## Execution

To run the program, simply execute the following command in the root directory:

```bash
python3 super_auto_pets.py
```

* *I believe* that only the inbuilt terminal in Visual Studio Code can display emojis, so you should decline those when prompted if you're using another terminal.
* Your "team name" may be anything you wish.
* I would recommend agreeing to backup your teams. They'll be added to the `data` folder, so you may battle against them later. Otherwise, you'll simply be facing the handful of teams that I happened to create, which should also work perfectly fine.
